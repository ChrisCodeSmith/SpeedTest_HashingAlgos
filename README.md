# Fast simple explanation of the GUI:
## Why
- To compare the speed and showcase the simplicity and correctness of hashing algorithms

## Buttons:
### Create Files:
- It deletes all files in the temp folder everytime the button is pressed first and before creating new ones
- It creates the amount of files with the size you select in a temp folder
- It fills the files with random byte data


### Run:
- It creates copies of the files we previously created with 'Create Files'
- It hashes the original Files and the Copies and compares them
- It shows the time used to calc and compare the hashes, for each algo 
- It shows the amount of collisions. It should have 1 collision for 1 file you create.
